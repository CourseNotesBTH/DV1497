# Purpose of the repository
<a name="purpose"></a>

Learning new programming languages, algorithms, data structures etc. can be a tedious process. By providing real examples of solutions for various programming courses at BTH, we aim to shed light on typical assignments and projects given to students.

# Contributing
<a name="contributing"></a>

Any help with the project is more than welcome. If you have a course, an assignment, a project or the like you would like to share, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request to get the process in motion.

_This repository holds examples of solutions created by students. Although the solutions are most likely correct, they may not promote best practices, be performant or work on all systems. The solutions are meant for "learning by example", so beware not to submit these solutions to the same or similar course. We can not be held responsible for any consequences._
